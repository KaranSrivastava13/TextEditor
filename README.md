# TextEditor

                                        Explanation:

                                        
The provided code is a basic text editor application built using the Swing library. Here's how the code works:

The code imports necessary packages for building the GUI and handling user interactions.

The TextEditor class is defined, which extends JFrame and implements the ActionListener interface.

The constructor TextEditor() initializes the graphical user interface (GUI) components, sets up the layout, and configures the initial appearance of the text editor.

The actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method handles user actions like clicking buttons, selecting font options, and working with file menu items.

The main() method creates an instance of the TextEditor class, which starts the application.

The JTextArea component is used to display and edit text. It is wrapped in a JScrollPane to enable scrolling when the text overflows.

Font-related components include a font size spinner, a font color button, and a font selection combo box.

The menu bar and menu items (Open, Save, Exit) provide file-related functionality.

When the font color button is clicked, a color chooser dialog is displayed to choose the text color.

The font selection combo box allows users to choose different font families for the text.

The "Open" menu item opens a file chooser dialog to load and display the content of a selected text file.

The "Save" menu item opens a file chooser dialog to save the text content of the text area into a selected file.

The "Exit" menu item exits the application.

The main() method creates an instance of the TextEditor class, launching the application.

This code provides a basic text editor with features to change font size and color, select different fonts, open and save files, and exit the application. While the code is functional, there are areas for improvement as mentioned earlier in the discussion.
